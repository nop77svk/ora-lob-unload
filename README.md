# Oracle LOB unloader

> **STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**

Ever needed to get those damned CLOBs/BLOBs out of the database and save them to your local PC's drive?

Look no further, for this utility is what you'll ever need. :-)

A note from the author
======================

As a long-time (15+ years) Oracle PL/SQL dev who's hit the boundaries of PL/SQL's capabilities (even with pretty heavy use of Oracle's OOP), I wanted to expand on the options of expressing myself via computer code. And while Java still seems to be widely more popular across the world, I've chosen C# and .NET (Core) as the "middle tier" platform of my choice simply because I somehow (irrationally, perhaps) liked the C# language more than the Java language. C# seems more concise, more readable, more pragmatic than Java and ever since I found out about the wonderful cross-platform .NET Core, my "destiny" seemed clear.

So, here it is! A simple "show-off" project of mine I wrote during learning the C#, .NET Core, different OOP techniques (that were not possible anymore within my beloved PL/SQL's "mantinels") and various code writing principles of C# world.
